# The `pdSpecEst` package

The goal of `pdSpecEst` is to perform wavelet-based multivariate spectral density estimation and clustering in the Riemannian manifold of Hermitian and positive-definite matrices. This is based on the paper available at <http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03314>. 

For more details and examples on how to use the package we refer to the vignette. 

## Installation

The newest 'developmental' version is installed with `devtools::install_github("JorisChau/pdSpecEst")`.
