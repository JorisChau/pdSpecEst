# The `pdSpecEst` package


[![CRAN version](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/pdSpecEst)](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pdSpecEst/index.html)
[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JorisChau/pdSpecEst.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JorisChau/pdSpecEst)

This package provides data analysis tools for samples of symmetric or Hermitian positive definite matrices, such as collections of (non-degenerate) covariance matrices or spectral density matrices.

The tools in this package can be used to perform:

* *Manifold wavelet regression* and *clustering* for curves of Hermitian positive definite matrices. These implementations are based on the paper [@CvS17].

* Exploratory data analysis and inference for samples of Hermitian positive definite matrices by means of *generalized data depth* and *generalized rank-based hypothesis tests*. These implementations are based on the paper [@COvS17].

For more details and examples on how to use the package see the accompanying vignettes in the vignettes folder. 

A demo Shiny app to test out wavelet-based spectral matrix estimation and clustering is available [here](http://jchau.shinyapps.io/pdSpecEst_app).

*Author and maintainer:* Joris Chau (<j.chau@uclouvain.be>).

## Installation

* **Stable CRAN version:** install from within R

* **Current development version:** install via `devtools::install_github("JorisChau/pdSpecEst")`
