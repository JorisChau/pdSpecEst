Title: An Analysis Toolbox for Hermitian Positive Definite Matrices
Version: 1.1.2
Authors@R: person("Joris", "Chau", email = "j.chau@uclouvain.be", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: An implementation of data analysis tools for samples of symmetric or 
  Hermitian positive definite matrices, such as collections of covariance matrices 
  or spectral density matrices. The tools in this package can be used to perform (i) 
  intrinsic manifold wavelet regression and clustering for curves (1D) or surfaces (2D) 
  of Hermitian positive definite matrices, and (ii) exploratory data analysis and inference 
  for samples of (curves of) Hermitian positive definite matrices by means of intrinsic manifold 
  data depth and manifold rank-based hypothesis tests.
