Title: An Analysis Toolbox for Hermitian Positive Definite Matrices
Version: 1.1.2
Authors@R: person("Joris", "Chau", email = "j.chau@uclouvain.be", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: An implementation of data analysis tools for samples of symmetric or 
  Hermitian positive definite matrices, such as collections of covariance matrices 
  or spectral density matrices. The tools in this package can be used to perform (i) 
  manifold wavelet regression and clustering for curves of Hermitian positive definite 
  matrices, and (ii) exploratory data analysis and inference for samples of (curves of) 
  Hermitian positive definite matrices by means of manifold data depth and manifold 
  rank-based hypothesis tests.
