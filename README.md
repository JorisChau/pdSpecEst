The `pdSpecEst` package
=======================

The goal of `pdSpecEst` is to perform wavelet-based multivariate spectral density estimation and clustering in the Riemannian manifold of Hermitian and positive-definite matrices. This is based on the paper available at <http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03314>.

For more details and examples on how to use the package we refer to the vignette in the vignettes folder.
