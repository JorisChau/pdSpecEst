## CRAN package version 1.2.2

* Ubuntu 17.10 (local install) R 3.4.2, 1 note

checking installed package size ... NOTE
  installed size is  7.4Mb
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
    libs   6.5Mb
R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note 

My understanding is that the inflation of the libs subdirectory is due to the use of `Rcpp` and `RcppArmadillo`.
