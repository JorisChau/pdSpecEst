## Test environments

* local windows 7 install, R 3.3.1
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.2
* osx 10.11.6 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.2

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

Win-builder devel and release note:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Joris Chau <j.chau@uclouvain.be>'

Travis-ci note (linux):

* checking installed package size ... NOTE
    installed size is  8.1Mb
    sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
      libs   7.9Mb
      
- My understanding is that the inflation of the libs subdirectory is due to the use of Rcpp and RcppArmadillo. 

## Resubmission

This is a resubmission resolving 1 note. 

* checking compiled code ... NOTE
File ‘pdSpecEst/libs/pdSpecEst.so’:
  Found no calls to: ‘R_registerRoutines’, ‘R_useDynamicSymbols’

- To resolve this note I added pdSpecEst_init.c (generated by Kmisc::registeringFunctions) in order to register native symbols and disable dynamic symbol search.


## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
